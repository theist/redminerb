# Redminerb

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nando/redminerb.svg?branch=master)][travis]

Redminerb is a command-line suite that speaks with our Redmine through its REST API.

It's based on the code and ideas present in Restminer[0]. Gracias Carlos!!!

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'redminerb'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install redminerb

## Usage

### Configuration (config)

To see the current configuration used by Redminerb we have the `config` command:

    $ redminerb config
    URL: http://localhost:3000/
    API_KEY: 69b47d74e36a6757bac5d45f8398dd23bfa8f52c

Currently the config is read only from the **~/.redminerb.yml** file.


### Users

    $ redminerb users # a.k.a. redminerb users list

That should give you the current users on your Redmine server, one per line.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
